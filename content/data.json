{"entries":[{"id":"VccTMX","title":"Introduction","body":"Dashpilot is a hosted headless CMS that saves data to your own GitHub repository. Just authorize Dashpilot to access your Github account, choose a repo and start creating!\n\n## Benefits of storing data on Github\n\n### Access to a whole ecosystem\nDashpilot seemlessly fits into the whole ecosystem of static site generators, build tools, applications and hosting services that work with content and code in your Github repo. Every time you save content from Dashpilot to your Github repo, you can automatically trigger a static site generator to generate a new version of your site, and automatically trigger hosting services like Netlify or Vercel to host the latest version of your site. Dashpilot also works with Single Page Applications built with frameworks like React, Vue or Svelte, no matter if your SPA is hosted through Github or elsewhere.\n\n### No vendor lock-in, own your own data\nBecause the data is stored in your own Github Repo, you own and control your data. If you ever decide to choose switch to another CMS, there's nothing to migrate or delete and the data can be easily imported into another CMS. Dashpilot stores no information about you, so moving away is as simple as not using Dashpilot anymore.\n\n### Secure\nWhenever you log in, Dashpilot connects to your Github repo and receives a temporary access token. Once you log out (or the token expires), Dashpilot can not access your Github repo. So you're in control of when Dashpilot has access to your Github account. Furthermore, because of Github's version management features, you can always revert to a previous version of your data if anything goes wrong.\n\n### Nothing to install or update\nDashpilot is a hosted CMS, so you don't have to install or update any software.\n\n## How data is stored\nAll data will be saved as a json file, so you can use it in Single Page Apps without any additional processing or build steps. Any uploaded images are automatically resized and optimized for the web, again saving you additional conversion.

This allows you to configure a number of options:\n- the folder/path where your content is saved\n- the URL of your live website\n- custom fields\n\n### Creating the configuration file\n\nFirst, create a file called `dashpilot.yml` at the root of your repo. The configuration options  can be set with plain YAML.\n\n### Basic options\n\n```\nconfig\n\tpath: 'public/content' # where to store the data, default: 'content'\n\tsiteurl: 'https://examplepage.net' # your website's live url\n```\n\n### Custom fields\nWith custom fields you can extend Dashpilot with any extra input fields your website might need. This allows you use Dashpilot in more complex scenarios. You can also define serveral sets of custom fields (in Dashpilot such a set is called a 'layout') and users can select which set/layout to use for a particular post. Here's a basic example of a custom fields configuration which creates two layouts ('post' and 'member'), each containing two custom fields:\n\n```\n\nlayouts:\n\t- name: posts\n\tfields: \n\t\t- {name: \"subtitle\", type: \"txt\"}\n\t\t- {name: \"summary\", type: \"txt\"}\n\t- name: members\n\tfields:\n\t\t- {name: \"firstname\", type: \"txt\"}\n\t\t- {name: \"lastname\", type: \"txt\"}\n```","category":"docs","image":"","images":[],"meta":[],"draft":false}],"categories":[{"name":"default","slug":"default","fields":[]},{"name":"docs","slug":"docs"},{"name":"blog","slug":"blog"}]}

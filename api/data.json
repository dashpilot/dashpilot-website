{"config":{"path":"api"},"entries":[{"id":"3KvB5k89","title":"Configuration options","body":"Apart from the options available through the Dashpilot interface, you can customize Dashpilot by creating a configuration file at the root of your repo. This allows you to configure a number of options:\n- the folder/path where your content is saved\n- the URL of your live website\n- custom fields\n\n### Creating the configuration file\n\nFirst, create a file called `dashpilot.yml` at the root of your repo. The configuration options  can be set with plain YAML.\n\n### Basic options\n\n```\nconfig\n\tpath: 'public/content' # where to store the data, default: 'content'\n\tsiteurl: 'https://examplepage.net' # your website's live url\n```\n\n### Custom fields\nWith custom fields you can extend Dashpilot with any extra input fields your website might need. This allows you use Dashpilot in more complex scenarios. You can also define serveral sets of custom fields (in Dashpilot such a set is called a 'layout') and users can select which set/layout to use for a particular post. Here's a basic example of a custom fields configuration which creates two layouts ('post' and 'member'), each containing two custom fields:\n\n```\n\nlayouts:\n- name: posts\n\tfields: \n\t\t- {name: \"subtitle\", type: \"txt\"}\n\t\t- {name: \"summary\", type: \"txt\"}\n- name: members\n\tfields:\n\t\t- {name: \"firstname\", type: \"txt\"}\n\t\t- {name: \"lastname\", type: \"txt\"}\n```","category":"docs","image":"","images":[],"meta":[],"draft":false}],"categories":[{"name":"default","slug":"default","fields":[]},{"name":"docs","slug":"docs"},{"name":"blog","slug":"blog"}]}
